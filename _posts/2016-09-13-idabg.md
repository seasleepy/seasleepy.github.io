What with the currently ongoing [Humble Bundle](https://www.humblebundle.com/gamemaker-bundle), I finally got around to reinstalling Gamemaker, and am trying to commit myself to go through some of the intro tutorials (which is farther than I got during the *last* Humble Gamemaker Bundle).  And thus, having completed the first video in the widely recommended [Tom Francis series of tutorials](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLUtKzyIe0aB2HjpmBhnsHpK7ig0z7ohWw), I have a blue guy who can go wasd and warp around with the q key.  *Exciting.*

Now to configure Gamemaker to use git for source control and you can all see exactly how exciting it is.
